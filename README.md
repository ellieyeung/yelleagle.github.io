<span style="background-color:grey">About

Hi, I am Ellie Yeung, a 6th year Biomedical Engineering and Computer Science and Engineering double major seeking full-time opportunities for firmware development starting April 2017. As I'm figuring out the answer to life, I learned the best way for me to live is to follow my heart. After many opportunities to learn about myself and others, I'm coming up to a hypothesis, that I love helping others and building cool devices.

Moving from Hong Kong myself, I know the unnecessary feelings when adapting to a new country. I have joined leadership retreats and organizations that share experiences, discuss the issues of being a minority, and promote equity. I also found myself in volunteering opportunities to discourage being affected by stereotypes and to advocate STEM to younger students that did not necessarily have exposure to different opportunities.

From robotics in high school and coursework and side projects in college, I've discovered an interest in building devices in all aspects, mechanically assembling metal pieces, electrically connecting components, and programming components to enable controls of the device.

Shadowing in my school's Veterinary Medicine Teaching Hospital for clinical needs analysis, I realized the lack of new medical procedure tools and devices. A lot of human medical devices only need slight modifications to turn into animal devices, to account for the different anatomy of different animals. Currently, my end goal to be working on animals' medical devices.

As I was taking courses and side projects, I found myself having a passion for embedded software and firmware. For my senior capstone project, I wrote an Arduino program for a Teensy, which uses the same IDE as an Arduino. I have also taken courses such as embedded systems, computer architecture, and declarative programming to find an interest in programming for a lower-level and for functionality. I'm currently seeking full-time opportunities in related fields. If any of you are looking for an organized person that loves to learn and has passion in embedded firmware, feel free to contact me at ellie (at) ellieyeung (dot) me</span>
